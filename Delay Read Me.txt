****CPE4400 Spring 2022****

Software repository for calculating internal delay of STM32 in conjunction with various wireless communication technologies.
This project uses Arduino and STM32 Cube IDE.

Table of Contents:

interrupt_generator.ino - Program that generates 1Hz pulses on Arduino Uno (A1).

interrupt_receiver.ino - When the pulse is received by the Arduino Mega (A2), it generates its own pulse.

RF_generator.ino - Program for RF transmitter that generates 1 HZ RF pulses on A1

RF_receiver.ino - Program for RF receiver that receives RF pulse and calculates delays

Final Nucleo Delay - STM32CubeIDE project that captures the output of A1 and A2 and calculates delays.
